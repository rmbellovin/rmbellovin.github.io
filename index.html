<p>
I am a mathematician studying algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry; I also have a long-standing interest in cryptography.  I am currently an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut.  I was previously a member at the Institute for Advanced Study, a Rankin&ndash;Sneddon Fellow at the University of Glasgow, and a Imperial College Research Fellow and postdoc. Prior to that, I was an NSF postdoc at UC Berkeley and a graduate student at Stanford. I received my Ph.D. in 2013 under the supervision of Brian Conrad, and my thesis was on p-adic Hodge theory in rigid analytic families.

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>
In Fall 2024, I am teaching two sections of Math 2410Q: Elementary Differential Equations at UConn.
<p>
In Spring 2023, I taught 1C at the University of Glasgow to first-year undergraduates.
<p>
In Autumn 2022, I taught 2C Introduction to Real Analysis at the University of Glasgow to second-year undergraduates.
<p>
In Spring 2022, I taught 4H/5E Galois Theory at the University of Glasgow.
<p>
In Spring 2017, I taught <a href=teaching/m3p12.html>M3/4/5P12 Group Representation Theory</a> at Imperial College London.
<h3>Expository notes</h3>
Here are some things I've written, on various topics.
<p>
<a href="./writings/L08.pdf">Raynaud's results on F-vector group schemes</a>.  These are notes I wrote for a talk in the <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~akshay/ntslearn.html">learning seminar</a> on Faltings's proof of the Mordell conjecture.  They are actually part 2; part 1 was given by Melanie Wood.
<p>
<a href="./writings/shaf-talk.pdf">Mordell conjecture</a>.  These are notes I wrote for another talk in the <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~akshay/ntslearn.html">learning seminar</a> on Faltings's proof of the Mordell conjecture.
<p>
<a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/modseminar/pdf/L07.pdf">Notes on Galois Cohomology</a>.  These are notes I wrote for a talk in the <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/modseminar">modularity lifting seminar</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/modseminar/pdf/L20.pdf">Calculating Deformation Rings, for \ell \neq p</a>.  These are notes I wrote for another talk in the <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/modseminar">modularity lifting seminar</a>.
<p>
<a href="./writings/chaum.pdf">Cryptography: Authentication, Blind Signatures, and Digital Cash</a>.  These are notes I wrote up for a talk on David Chaum's amazing work on digital cash.  I've given the talk twice, once to high school students (at <a href="http://www.promys.org">PROMYS</a>) and once to undergraduates (at <a href="http://sumo.stanford.edu/speakers/2010">Stanford</a>).
<p>
<a href="./writings/enigma.pdf">Cracking the Enigma</a>.  These are the slides for a talk I gave to <a href="http://sumo.stanford.edu/speakers/2012">Stanford undergraduates</a> on an early Polish break of Enigma.

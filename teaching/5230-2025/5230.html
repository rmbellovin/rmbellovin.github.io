<h3>
	Homework
</h3>
Homework will generally be due every other week on Thursdays and cover material from the previous two weeks' lectures.  You may either hand-write your solutions or type them (if you choose to type your solutions, I strongly urge you to learn LaTeX).  It is only mandatory for undergraduates, but I strongly urge PhD students to do as many exercises as possible.

<h3>
	Textbook
</h3>
We will primarily follow <i>Number Fields</i> by Marcus.  We will also refer to Neukirch's <i>Algebraic Number Theory</i> for some material (particularly on local fields).
<br><br>
Keith Conrad has extensive notes on Galois theory and algebraic number theory, which you may additionally find useful.

<h3>
	Assessment
</h3>
Grades in this class will be based on homework.  There will be no final exam.

<h4>Academic integrity</h4>
Please respect your work and the work of others. Cheating will be taken seriously. Examples of things that will be addressed include, but are not limited to, communicating with anyone not explicitly allowed during any quiz or exam, representing another person's work as your own (this includes copying or paraphrasing a solution from a friend, solution manual, tutor, or website), or bringing unauthorized materials to any quiz or exam. Consequences may include, but are not limited to, a score of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam, or a grade of F in the course.
